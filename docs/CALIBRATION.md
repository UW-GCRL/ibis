# Calibration

Started 2026-09-09, after the fire and methane modules were re-validated on the
corrected carbon cycle. Order set by Hangkai: carbon, then ET, then the smaller
parts. Methane is evaluated against FLUXNET-CH4 (Chenchen's processing).

## 0. What already existed, and what had to be fixed before fitting

`scripts/calibrate_fluxnet.py` (Min) already had the right architecture: all
sites in one `npoi` vector, so a parameter evaluation is a single model run,
driving CMA-ES over per-PFT `vmax`/`specla` and Ball-Berry `coefm`/`coefb`
with literature bounds. 202 sites load against current code.

Four things had to be fixed or ruled out first.

**The restart would not load.** "258 leaves but template has 257". `both_fix`
was written with `nbedrock: 3` (docs/BEDROCK.md); a template built with
`nbedrock=3` matches at 258 leaves with zero shape mismatches.

**The site-to-cell mapping had to be proved, not assumed.** `surta.nc` is N->S
(89.75 first), matching the harness's `GSWP3_LAT`, and `nland = 95,333` equals
the restart `npoi`. `argwhere` (run_global) and `where(ravel())` (harness) give
identical row-major order. Geography: corr(|lat|, deep soil T) = **-0.851**
over all land and **-0.891** at the 205 sites; southernmost sites return
Australian, northernmost Svalbard.

**`specla` is dead in that harness.** It appears only in
`vegetation_dynamics` (`plai = cbiol * specla`), and `calibrate_fluxnet.py`
never calls `dynaveg` -- 12 of its 38 CMA-ES parameters had no effect on the
loss. Twelfth instance of the defect-0 pattern, first one in calibration code.
`verify/calibration/site_transient.py` does call `dynaveg`, so `specla` is
reachable there.

**`reco = ayco2mic` is Rh, not Reco**, and fitting Rh needs centuries of
soil-carbon re-equilibration per evaluation. Reco is reported, never fitted.

## 1. Towers cannot set the GPP magnitude

At the 131 matched cells the model is **1.09x FLUXCOM** (own LAI) / 1.04x
(MODIS LAI), consistent with 1.01x globally -- but **0.81x the tower value**.
FLUXCOM at the same cells is **0.75x the tower value**:

| IGBP | n | tower | FLUXCOM | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ENF | 49 | 1.35 | 0.89 | 0.64x |
| DBF | 24 | 1.53 | 1.04 | 0.69x |
| EBF | 15 | 2.29 | 1.64 | 0.76x |
| GRA | 37 | 0.92 | 0.74 | 0.81x |

A gridded product trained on these towers is also well below them at their own
cells: the gap is 0.5-degree representativeness. Fitting it away would have
inflated global GPP ~1.4x while every site plot appeared to improve. Towers
constrain **scale-insensitive** quantities -- WUE, seasonality, interannual
variability, PFT ordering. Magnitude stays anchored to the gridded products.

FLUXCOM is `g m-2 day-1`. Read as `kgC m-2 yr-1` it gives a nonsense 2.03x.
Second time that unit has bitten; `x365.25/1000` both times.

## 2. The missing transient, and why it mattered less than expected

`both_fix` CYCLES 1901-2000 forcing at a fixed 350 ppm, so its end state is
equilibrated to the 20th-century mean, not to the trajectory a tower measured.
Hangkai asked for the step between spin-up and validation; it was missing.

`site_transient.py` runs 1901-1996 with real GSWP3, rising CO2 and `dynaveg`,
then evaluates 1997-2006. Legitimate at 171 cells rather than 95,333 because
IBIS has **no lateral coupling** -- no routing, no groundwater exchange -- so
each column integrates independently.

Result: soil carbon drifted **-1.5% over 86 years**, and on the same 131 sites
GPP/FLUXCOM went **1.09x -> 1.10x**. The spin-up CO2 inconsistency is
immaterial. Worth adding for correctness; it was not hiding anything.

There was also **no transient CO2 anywhere in the model** -- `co2init` is a
scalar applied once at state creation, so even `calibration_transient` held
296 ppm. `ibis/io/co2.py` adds a published trajectory with its provenance and
limits stated.

## 3. The residual is cold-structured, not aridity-structured

Recorded because it was claimed the other way first. Binning model/FLUXCOM by
precipitation put the worst band (<400 mm) at 0.26x, and the transient
appeared to fix it (0.26 -> 1.00). It did not: that was a **sample artifact**,
two runs drawing different site sets. On common sites, 0.26 -> 0.29.

The low-ratio "dry" cells are CA-Man, CA-NS1-NS7, US-Prr, RU-Che, RU-Cok,
US-Atq, US-Ivo, GL-ZaF, GL-NuF -- all 55-75N. Their precipitation is low
*because they are cold*. The binning conflated the two.

Globally, from `both_fix` year 2200:

| band | IBIS LAI | MODIS | ratio | GPP | NPP | cveg |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30S-30N | 3.51 | 1.83 | 1.91x | 1.295 | 0.576 | 3.67 |
| 30-50N | 3.20 | 1.36 | 2.35x | 0.730 | 0.366 | 3.44 |
| 50-60N | 2.20 | 2.16 | 1.02x | 0.500 | 0.278 | 2.59 |
| 60-70N | 0.46 | 1.40 | **0.33x** | 0.112 | 0.063 | 0.63 |
| 70-90N | 0.03 | 0.21 | **0.13x** | 0.006 | 0.003 | 0.03 |

**2x too leafy in the tropics and mid-latitudes, 3-8x too bare above 60N.**
The global mean is right because the errors cancel.

Not the bioclimatic filter: at 60-70N `exist` permits evergreen shrub,
deciduous shrub and C3 grass in **96%** of cells and boreal conifer in 59%,
but their leaf area is 0.09, ~0, 0.08 and 0.02. The PFTs are allowed and do
not grow -- the low-LAI -> low-GPP -> low-NPP -> low-LAI attractor named in
docs/GPP.md.

## 4. `vmax x0.54` put nine of twelve PFTs below physical minimum

Against the calibration harness's own literature bounds:

| PFT | current | IBIS default | range | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tropical_broadleaf_evergreen | 35.1 | 65.0 | 40-100 | below |
| warm_temperate_bl_evergreen | 21.6 | 40.0 | 25-70 | below |
| temperate_broadleaf_deciduous | 16.2 | 30.0 | 20-60 | below |
| **boreal_conifer_evergreen** | **13.5** | 25.0 | **15-40** | **below** |
| boreal_broadleaf_deciduous | 16.2 | 30.0 | 20-50 | below |
| evergreen / deciduous shrub | 14.9 | 27.5 | 15-45 | below |
| c3_grass | 13.5 | 25.0 | 15-45 | below |

The scalar did not merely fudge the global mean; it pushed most of the model's
photosynthetic capacity outside plausible physiology, and it did so uniformly
-- suppressing high-latitude productivity that was already 3-8x too low in
order to offset tropical/temperate leaf area that is 2x too high.

### Consequence for the Arctic methane and soil-carbon deficits

NPP at 70-90N is **0.003 kgC m-2 yr-1**. At equilibrium `pool = input x
residence time`, so even a millennial residence time yields almost nothing --
which is why Arctic soil carbon is 4.33 against NCSCD's ~55, and CH4 north of
60N is 1.0% against a target 8%. docs/METHANE.md 5q attributed this to missing
cryoturbation, vertical resolution and deep carbon. Those gaps are real, but
underneath them is a more elementary one: **there is almost no carbon input to
decompose, because the model grows almost no vegetation there.** The "~6x
lower Arctic Rh per unit area" is downstream of this.

## 5. LAI is a weak lever on GPP

Measured elasticity `dlnGPP/dlnLAI` between the two prescribed-LAI arms:

| band | n | LAI a | LAI b | elasticity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <30N | 15 | 5.31 | 2.89 | **0.04** |
| 30-50N | 81 | 5.23 | 2.45 | 0.09 |
| 50-60N | 29 | 4.14 | 2.60 | 0.10 |
| all | 128 | 4.95 | 2.54 | **0.09** |

Beer-Lambert `1-exp(-0.5 L)` implies 0.22 (LAI 5) to 0.58 (LAI 2) over the
same range. The formula itself is faithful: `canopy_scaling` gives
`scale = (1-exp(-extpar(lai+sai)))/(extpar*lai)`, and multiplied by `lai` this
is `A_top (1-exp(-k(L+S)))/k`, the correct big-leaf integral. The weak
response is a *consequence* of an optically thick canopy -- stem area also
intercepts, and `extpar(L+S)` is large enough that absorbed light is nearly
saturated.

**So correcting LAI will not correct GPP**, and the two biases have to be
fixed with different parameters: `vmax` for GPP, `specla` for LAI. That also
means the 2x LAI excess contributes little to the GPP excess, so the 1.55x
gap docs/GPP.md left open is not an LAI artifact.

## Where this leaves the 1.55x problem

It is now localised rather than solved. IBIS with physically plausible `vmax`
overpredicts GPP in warm and temperate regions and underpredicts it above
60N; a single global scalar traded one against the other and landed the mean
on FLUXCOM. Restoring `vmax` globally is not available: `both_fix` measured
`dlnGPP/dlnVmax = 0.75`, so undoing x0.54 returns ~211 PgC/yr against a
published 120-130.

## Status

* Stage 1 (carbon) -- diagnosis complete, fitting not started.
* Stage 2 (ET) -- not started. Model ET is 1.22x tower and WUE 0.75x, so the
  error is in the coupling; `vmax` and `coefm` will need fitting jointly
  rather than carbon-then-ET.
* Stage 3 (methane) -- 459 AmeriFlux CH4 site-years, of which only **51 (11%)**
  fall within GSWP3's 2010 cutoff, and only 25 of 170 north of 60N. The CH4
  sites carry their own gap-filled meteorology, so they will be driven from
  tower forcing rather than GSWP3. 43 EuroFlux sites additionally available.
