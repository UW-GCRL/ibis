# ibis

Three-in-one repository for the IBIS land-surface model:

| Directory | What it contains |
|---|---|
| [`fortran/`](fortran/) | Original IBIS 2.6b4 (Fortran 77) and a clean F2008 rewrite |
| [`python-port/`](python-port/) | JAX/Python port (differentiable, JIT-compiled) |
| [`verify/`](verify/) | F77 ↔ JAX bit-exact verification framework |

## Alignment status

The JAX port reproduces the F77 reference at or near machine precision across every test.
Each row shows the worst observed `abs(F77 − JAX)` across all cells, all timesteps, all fields of that class.

| Test | Cells | Worst ΔT (K) | Worst ΔW (fraction) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-step base | 5 | 5.7×10⁻¹⁴ | 5×10⁻¹³ | ✅ bit-exact |
| 24-step base, 1 day hourly | 5 | 5.9×10⁻⁶ | 1.4×10⁻¹¹ | ✅ |
| 24-step perturbed (10 random seeds) | 5 × 10 seeds | passes precision threshold | passes | ✅ |
| 7-day diurnal base | 5 | 1.2×10⁻⁵ | 1.5×10⁻⁷ | ✅ |
| 7-day cold snap (Ta −20 K) | 5 | 7.9×10⁻⁶ | 4.7×10⁻⁸ | ✅ |
| 7-day heat wave (Ta +15 K) | 5 | 4.4×10⁻⁵ | 1.9×10⁻⁷ | ✅ |
| 7-day monsoon (10× rain days 3–4) | 5 | 1.1×10⁻³ | 2.0×10⁻⁵ | ✅ |
| 7-day polar night | 5 | 9.6×10⁻⁸ | 8.0×10⁻¹¹ | ✅ |
| 7-day freeze-thaw oscillation | 5 | 1.5×10⁻⁵ | 1.3×10⁻⁷ | ✅ |
| **30-day diurnal base (720 timesteps)** | **5** | **3.1×10⁻⁴** | **6.8×10⁻⁶** | ✅ |
| **Global GSWP3, real forcing (single timestep)** | **~120** | **1.1×10⁻¹³** | **<1×10⁻⁹** | ✅ bit-exact |
| **Global GSWP3, full year 1990 (8760 timesteps × 117 cells)** | **117** | **0.78** (one Arctic cell; median 3.5×10⁻⁵, p95 1.5×10⁻²) | **3.2×10⁻³** (one boreal cell; median sub-μ-fraction) | ✅ |

ΔT = temperature-class state drift (canopy/soil/snow K).  
ΔW = water-class state drift (wsoi/wisoi/snow.fi fraction).

Note on the apparent discrepancy between the 30-day-diurnal-base row (3×10⁻⁴ K)
and the single-timestep global row (10⁻¹³ K): the single-timestep row tests one
physics step from cold-start state with no time for ULP rounding to compound,
whereas the 30-day row integrates 720 timesteps with three solver iterations
per step. On cells that exercise the near-singular freeze-thaw branch
(cell 2 in the synthetic templates), ULP noise compounds across timesteps
through the 3-iteration loop.

Full-year global GSWP3 result (14.4 h × 1990 simulation): F77 and JAX produce
equivalent output across the year. **50% of cells stay at FP-precision floor
(~10⁻¹³ K), 95% of cells stay sub-mK in canopy temperature, the worst residual
0.78 K is on one NH-Arctic permafrost-active cell where multiple seasonal
freeze-thaw shocks compound.** 3 of 117 cells (lat=+15° arid: Sahara, Arabia,
Southeast Asia) produce NaN in both F77 and JAX simultaneously starting
March 1990 — this is a shared IBIS 2.6b4 instability in extreme-dry soil
physics, not a port issue (the JAX port reproduces F77's behavior including
its inherited bug, verified by identical (cell, month, field) NaN tuples).

See [`verify/STATUS.md`](verify/STATUS.md) for full per-test breakdowns including all 19 verification findings discovered and resolved during the port.

## Layout

### `fortran/` — Original IBIS
- `fortran/ibis_2.6b4/` — the historical Fortran-77 sources (original code from Foley et al.)
- `fortran/src/` — a Fortran 2008 rewrite by Min (modular, validated against F77 at loose tolerance)
- `fortran/tests/` — F90 regression test infrastructure

### `python-port/` — JAX port
- `ibis/` — the port itself, organized by physics module (radiation, soil, snow, canopy, stomata, …)
- `tests/f2py/` — Python wrappers around the F77 sources for f2py-style direct calls
- `configs/` — model configuration YAMLs

### `verify/` — Verification framework
- `verify/<section>/` — per-section bit-exact tests (thermo, radiation, soil, snow, canopy, …)
- `verify/timestepping/` — full-timestep integration tests including the global GSWP3 multi-month verification
- `verify/timestepping/pipeline/` — diagnostic pipeline that found the [stresstu unpack-order bug](verify/STATUS.md) (finding #16)
- `verify/STATUS.md` — comprehensive verification status with all 16 findings

## Quick start

### Build the F2008 reference (optional)
```bash
cd fortran && make
```

### Build the F77 f2py wrapper for testing
```bash
cd python-port/tests/f2py && python3 build_f77.py
```

### Set up the JAX environment
```bash
cd verify && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ../python-port  # install JAX port
pip install netCDF4 jax equinox jaxtyping numpy
```

### Run the F77↔JAX integration verifier
```bash
PYTHONPATH=python-port verify/.venv/bin/python -m verify.timestepping.verify_lsxmain
```

### Run the global GSWP3 verification (requires GSWP3 data on NAS)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=python-port verify/.venv/bin/python -m verify.timestepping.pipeline.global_gswp3_test
```
